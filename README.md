code from my master's thesis work. has sat in a backup folder for a 
decade. might be useful? 

aaa - approximate anisotropic alpha-shapes, c++ code
    - bonus contains min-heap and union-find implementation

viewCycleEvolve - viewer for fieldlines, written for Java3D. Can't get 
                - it to work on modern computers, Java3D may have changed

example_data - sample data & output
